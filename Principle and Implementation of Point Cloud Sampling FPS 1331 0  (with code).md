#  First, the principle of FPS 

 Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) is a common method in point cloud sampling, which is used to select M (M < N) points from N points. The specific steps are as follows: Assume that the original point set is, there are N points in A, the sampled point set is, and the initial state B is empty. You need to select M points from the point set to the point set. The steps are as follows:
