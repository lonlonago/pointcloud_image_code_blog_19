 This is a deep learning framework for 3D point clouds, providing a general deep learning model of common point cloud analysis methods. It relies primarily on Pytorch Geometric and Facebook Hydra. The framework is capable of building lean and complex models with minimal cost and great reproducibility. The goal is to build a tool for benchmarking SOTA models while allowing researchers to study point cloud analysis efficiently, with the ultimate goal of building models that can be applied to practical applications. The code has been open-sourced https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d (and seems to have been updated recently) engineering structure  

 As a function library, it necessarily provides some common deep learning algorithms and interfaces, and divides models and datasets by task. Supports segmentation, classification, and registration. Supported datasets
